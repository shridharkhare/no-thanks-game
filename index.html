                    possible to learn while still being fun to play. Players
                    must employ strategic <b>Decision-making</b> and skillful
                    <b>Risk Management</b>. Evaluating the value of each card,
                    understanding when to take risks and when to play it safe,

                    score. <br />
                    <br />Players will need to exercise their judgement and

                        >The goal of the game is to have the lowest score at the

                <h4>Intial setup</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The game is played with a <em>custom deck</em> of cards
                        numbered from 3 to 35.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Nine cards are randomly removed and the deck is
                        shuffled.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        At the start of the game, each player is given 11 chips.
                        Chips are worth one negative point each.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Gameplay</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Each turn, a card is flipped from the deck.</li>

                    <li>
                        The player can either
                        <mark>pay one chip to pass</mark> saying "No thanks!" or
                        <mark>take the card</mark> and the chips on it.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        If they pass, they place one of their chips on the card
                        and move the card to the next player.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        If the player doesn't have any chips left, then the
                        player must take the card.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        If the player takes the card, they add it to their score
                        and collect any chips on it. The player then flips the
                        next card from the deck and the process repeats.
                    </li>

                    <li>The game ends when the deck is empty.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Scoring</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        At the end of the game, players accrue points from cards
                        according to their value, but cards in a row only count
                        as a single card with the lowest value. (e.g., a run
                        with cards numbered 30, 29, 28, 27 is worth 27 points).
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Number of chips are subtracted from the score as they
                        <mark>worth one negative point.</mark>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        The player(s) with the lowest number of points win(s)
                        the game.
                    </li>
                </ul>
